									Mapmaking
Creating a map for Diplomat is as simple as creating a text file in the "data/maps" directory and changing the file type to ".diplomap."
The map which the program loads will change depending on the contents of the map file.

Maps MUST contain only lowercase characters.
Although the map will load perfectly fine with uppercase characters, the user will not be able to interact with components with uppercase identifiers.

Map files are loaded line-by-line. Lines use a special syntax to tell the program how to load the object they represent, which depends on the type of object.

The program reads map files according to a few special rules:
- Lines that begin with a pound ("#") or are empty will be completely ignored. This is for adding comments and sectioning the map to be more readable by humans.
- Each part of a line must be separated by a single space.
- Lists are surrounded by square brackets ("[]"). Square brackets still must be surrounded by spaces (i.e. "1 2 3 [ 4 5 6 7 8 ] 9 10").
- Empty or ignored values must be filled with a hyphen ("-"). Empty lists still must have square brackets surrounding them (i.e. "1 2 - 4 [ - ] 6 - 8").
- Boolean values must be written exactly as either "t" (for true) or "f" (for false).

Specific parts of a line:
- The first element in each line must be a unique identifier for that object.
- The second element in each line is the "load query identifier." This defines the type of object being loaded by the line.

After the load query identifier, the contents of the line change based on the type of object being loaded.
Many object types are included with Diplomat - the syntax for those are listed below. Object types from mods should be described somewhere within the mod.

								Default load query identifiers:

n [ names ] [ productive_territories ]
Creates a nation.
The nation can be referred to by any string within "names" (such as with the VIEW command).
"productive_territories" is a list of unique identifiers for the territories on the map which the nation can use to produce units.
Example: "1 n [ i italy ] [ 52 59 77 ]" creates Italy in europe.diplomap.
- 1 is the unique identifier of Italy.
- "n" denotes a nation.
- "i" and "italy" are values which can be used to refer to Italy using commands.
- 52 (Naples), 59 (Rome), and 77 (Venice) are the three territories which Italy can use to produce units.

w|l|h [ names ] owner_identifier [ adjacent_territory_identifiers ] is_supply_center
Creates a territory. "w" creates a water territory, "l" creates a land territory, and "h" creates a hybrid territory.
The territory can be referred to by any string within "names" (such as with the VIEW command).
"owner_identifier" contains the unique identifier of the nation that owns this territory. Can be replaced with a hyphen for unowned territory.
"adjacent_territory_identifiers" is a list of territories which touch this one, and can be moved to directly from this one.
"is_supply_center" is a boolean value which determines whether or not the territory increases the maximum number of units for its owner.
Example: "8 w [ adr adriatic adriaticsea ] - [ 10 13 38 73 77 ] f
- 8 is the unique identifier of the Adriatic Sea.
- "w" denotes a water territory.
- "adr," "adriatic," and "adriaticsea" are the three ways which the player can refer to the Adriatic Sea in commands.
- The hyphen denotes that no nation owns the territory.
- 10 (Albania), 13 (Apulia), 38 (Ionian Sea), 73 (Trieste), and 77 (Venice) are the five territories which directly touch the Adriatic Sea.
- The "f" (for "false") denotes that the territory is not a supply center, meaning that it does not increase the maximum military size of its owner.

a|f owner_identifier location_identifier
Creates a military unit. "a" creates an army (land unit) and "f" creates a fleet (water unit).
"owner_identifier" denotes which nation owns the unit. Unlike with territories, all units must have an owner.
"location_identifier" denotes the current location of the unit. This value must also be filled by something other than a hyphen.
Example: "83 a 1 59"
- 83 is the unique identifier of the unit.
- "a" denotes an army (land unit).
- 1 (Italy) is the owner nation.
- 59 (Rome) is the location of the unit.
