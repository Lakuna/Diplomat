									Diplomat
								By Travis Martin / T3rrabyte / Lakuna

Diplomat is an experimental probability-based tool for determining the best outcome in the board game "Diplomacy."

In order to run the program, open the "_run.bat" file which comes in the root of the Diplomat folder.

Diplomat is a terminal-based program. It does not have a GUI. The user interacts with the program using a set of premade commands.
A standard simple usage of the program would look like this:

	load europe
	iterate

This will load the "europe" map (which is equivalent to a standard start in Diplomacy) and run 1000 simulated games to determine possible outcomes.

In order to simulate a game of Diplomacy that is currently being played, the user must create a custom map outside of the program and then load it in.
